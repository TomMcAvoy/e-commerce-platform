# Run with UI mode
npx playwright test --ui tests/e2e/social-platform.spec.ts
```

### Screenshots and Videos
- Screenshots: Captured on failure
- Videos: Retained on failure
- Traces: Available on first retry

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Run New Features E2E Tests
  run: pnpm run test:e2e:new
```

### Environment Variables
- `CI=true` - Enables CI-specific settings
- `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` - Browser installation path

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Servers not running**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:all
   ```

2. **Port conflicts**
   ```bash
   lsof -ti :3000 :3001 | xargs kill -9
   ```

3. **Database not seeded**
   ```bash
   pnpm run seed:full
   ```

4. **Browser installation**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

### Test Failures

1. Check server logs
2. Review test screenshots
3. Examine trace files
4. Verify test data

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in `tests/e2e/`
2. Use `NewFeaturesTestUtils` for common operations
3. Add test to `run-new-features.js`
4. Update package.json scripts
5. Document in this README

### Test Conventions
