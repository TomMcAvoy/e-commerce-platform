# ü§ñ AI-Powered Social Media Features

## üéØ Overview

Your social media platform now includes advanced AI-powered content moderation and automatic categorization features that ensure posts are placed in the correct categories and maintain community standards.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üß† Automatic Content Categorization
- **AI Analysis**: Posts are automatically analyzed to determine the most appropriate category
- **Smart Detection**: Recognizes content about pets, technology, health, finance, and more
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only moves posts when AI is confident about the categorization
- **Fallback System**: Works without OpenAI API using keyword-based analysis

### üõ°Ô∏è Content Moderation & Rewriting
- **Toxicity Detection**: Automatically identifies inappropriate language
- **Professional Rewriting**: Converts toxic content to neutral, professional language
- **Grammar Enhancement**: Improves grammar and readability
- **Community Standards**: Maintains a positive, welcoming environment

### üîî Smart Notifications
- **Category Changes**: Users are notified when their posts are moved to better categories
- **Content Updates**: Authors receive notifications when content is moderated
- **Transparent Process**: Clear explanations for all automatic changes

### üë∂ Safety Filtering
- **Age-Appropriate Content**: Different safety levels for kids, teens, and adults
- **Content Scoring**: All posts receive appropriateness ratings
- **Protected Browsing**: Ensures safe content for younger users

## üöÄ How It Works

### When a User Creates a Post

1. **Content Analysis**: AI analyzes the post content for category, topics, and appropriateness
2. **Category Check**: If the suggested category differs from user's choice, the post is moved
3. **Content Moderation**: Inappropriate language is automatically rewritten professionally
4. **Notification**: User receives notifications about any changes made
5. **Publication**: Post is published with appropriate safety ratings

### Example Transformations

```javascript
// Original toxic content
"This fucking app sucks and the developers are idiots!"

// AI-rewritten version
"I have some concerns about this app and would like to provide feedback to the developers."

// User notification
"Your post content was updated to maintain community standards and improve engagement."
```

### Category Auto-Detection Examples

| Original Category | Content | New Category | Reason |
|-------------------|---------|--------------|--------|
| `general-discussion` | "My dog loves playing fetch!" | `pets` | Pet-related content detected |
| `pets` | "Bitcoin is going to the moon!" | `business-finance` | Financial content in wrong category |
| `general-discussion` | "Learning JavaScript async/await" | `technology` | Programming content detected |
| `general-discussion` | "Started a new fitness routine" | `health-wellness` | Health/fitness content |

## üîß Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Analyzes content and provides suggestions
const analysis = await ContentAnalysisService.analyzeContent(content, currentCategory);

  topics: ['dog', 'training', 'pets'],
  appropriatenessScore: 9,
  needsModeration: false,
  toxicityLevel: 0,
  grammarScore: 8
}
```

### Notification System
```typescript
// Automatically notifies users of changes
await NotificationService.notifyPostRecategorized(
  userId,
  postId,
  'general-discussion',
  'pets',
  'Content better fits the pets category'
);
```
